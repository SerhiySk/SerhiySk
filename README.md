## Full-Stack Engineer focused on scalable systems, data infrastructure, and modern SaaS platforms.

I specialize in building production-grade applications across the stack — from high-performance frontend experiences to backend services and cloud infrastructure.

Currently a primary engineer at a VC-backed startup, working on architecture, migrations, and scalable platform development.
